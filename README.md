# Movie-ETL

I struggled to load the data. I cloned a repo improperly intially and had a mess of a directory. I let it play out and tried to troubleshoot at the end when it became necessary. However, I was unable to obtain the necessary connectivity between pgAdmin and my Jupyter notebooks. I plan to reassess tomorrow and resolve the module notebook and deliverable 4.

Overall, the intent of this project was to synthesize data from multiple sources into single, informative dataframes. We were expected to extract, transform, and load data across multiple platforms.
